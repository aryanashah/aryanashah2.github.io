  <h3>Ardmore Station Cafe</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I was asked to choose a restaurant that needed to be rebranded and I chose Ardmore Station Cafe. Ardmore Station Cafe is a small diner in Ardmore Pennsylvania that is right across from the Ardmore Train Station. I got the inspiration of putting the coffee cup on wheels from them being known for coffee and people going there when they are taking the train in and out of Ardmore Train Station. The deliverables for this project were a takeout container for a pastry, mug, letterhead, envelope, branding proposal and a folder for the restaurant.</p>

  <h3>Emily Dominick Photography</h3>
  </header>
  <p>In July 2019, I did an internship at Two Paper Dolls in Wayne. I was given a mock project where I was asked to design a brand identity for a company called Emily Dominick Photography. Every Tuesday and Thursday, I met with a design team where I was critiqued with which suggestions of what to add and what to change to my logo. The final logo was applied to a notecard, wooden USB drive, sticker, and a laser engraved wooden box. The sticker, notecard, and USB drive were all stored in the box. </p>
